#  Deep Learning and Neural Networks

### 1. Understanding-the-Amazon-from-Space---computer-vision--classification
[View Project](https://github.com/Isaac-Ndirangu-Muturi-749/Understanding-the-Amazon-from-Space---computer-vision--classification-)

Description: I aimed to develop an effective model for classifying satellite images from the Planet dataset, which includes various environmental labels. I began by preprocessing the data, extracting unique labels, and utilizing transfer learning with a pre-trained model. The model architecture involved convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification. I implemented data augmentation techniques and employed an ImageDataGenerator for efficient training. The training process utilized a custom loss function, and I monitored model performance using the F-beta score. Throughout the project, I leveraged tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas for data manipulation, model development, and result analysis. The final model demonstrated significant success in multi-label classification, showcasing its potential for environmental monitoring applications.
